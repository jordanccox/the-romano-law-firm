        As a full-service injury law firm full of passionate attorneys, The
        Romano Law Firm believes in fair compensation for all of our Odessa
        clients. If anyone that you know, or you yourself, have been injured in
        any way at the fault of another person, you should find a personal
        injury law firm that will stand up for you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From minor injury cases to much more severe ones, like

        >, The Romano Law Firm can handle all varieties of personal injury
        cases. We understand the large problems—physical, emotional, and
        financial—that can stem from even a minor injury. As a result, we want
        to make sure that you get the relief you really deserve, not just
        whatever the insurance company deems you deserve. Because we
        consistently get our clients paid more than they would have without
        representation, having a personal injury attorney from The Romano Law
        Firm represent you is a worthwhile investment.
