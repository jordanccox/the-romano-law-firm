        Choosing a Personal Injury Law Firm in Dupont Circle
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although there are a lot of Dupont Circle personal injury law firms out
        there, there are significantly fewer firms who have both the power of a
        large firm with the heart and individualized approach of a small firm.
        The Romano Law Firm is one of those special firms. Our customized
        approach for each client helps us do a more effective job of seeking
        financial compensation for you.
