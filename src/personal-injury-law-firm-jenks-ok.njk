        The number one goal of the Romano Law Firm is always to get fair
        compensation for our clients. We understand that you are the victim,
        which is why we do anything in our power to get justice for you. Our
        Jenks personal injury law firm has experience handling all varieties of
        personal injury cases, from very minor injuries to major

        cases.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Very serious physical and psychological problems can arise even from
        minor injuries, and our personal injury attorneys can help get you
        compensation for these problems. For example, if an injury has rendered
        you unable to do your job for some period of time, you may be entitled
        to some of the money you would have earned on the job. If you hire one
        of our experience lawyers to represent you in your personal injury case,
        not only will you receive the financial relief you deserve, but we will
        also make your voice heard.
