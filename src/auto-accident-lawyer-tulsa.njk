        If you or someone you love has been hurt in a car accident, then now is
        the time to speak to a Tulsa auto accident lawyer. The Romano Law Firm
        successfully handles all personal injury cases, specializing in auto
        accidents. If you have been injured due to someone else’s negligence,
        then you may be entitled to money to cover medical bills, vehicle
        repair, lost wages from time off of work and other costs.

        The best time to seek legal counsel is immediately following an
        accident. You don’t want to give out statements regarding an accident
        until you speak to a lawyer. Our trained team at the Romano Law Firm has
        the experience to handle communications with your insurance company. We
        don’t charge any hourly fees for negotiating with the insurance company,
        and we work to get you fair compensation.

        While auto accidents are extremely common, nobody plans for one ahead of
        time. Let an auto accident lawyer handle the paperwork and fight your
        battle so you can focus on your path to recovery.

      <h2 class="text-center">Filing an Auto Accident Claim in Tulsa</h2>
      <p>
        The accident claims process can seem scary, especially when you are
        trying to move forward from an accident. The best way to move on is to
        get the relief you deserve, which is why we recommend contacting an auto
        accident lawyer immediately following an accident. A fresh start is
        difficult when medical bills and physical and emotional recovery seem to
        be setting you back. We’ll step in right away, ensuring that you receive
        proper medical treatment that is well-documented.

        A majority of cases do not require litigation, but the Romano Law Firm
        can advise you on whether a lawsuit is necessary. If a lawsuit is
        pursued, we will handle the upfront costs because we are confident in
        our ability to get clients paid.

        Even if you are unsure about filing a claim, speaking to an experienced
        personal injury firm can’t hurt. Down the line you may regret that you
        did not file a claim, since often victims don’t decide until it’s too
        late. Speaking to a professional day will at least give you peace of
        mind on your path to recovery.
