        As a passionate yet experienced personal injury law firm, The Romano Law
        Firm believes in getting fair compensation for all of our Riverview

        Having handled a variety of personal injury cases, ranging from minor
        injuries to death, The Romano Law Firm has the experience to properly
        deal with your case. We understand that small injuries often grow into
        much larger physical, emotional, and financial problems. You deserve a
        voice, even when heavy-duty, well-financed insurance companies try to
        take it away from you. We have both the experience and the knowledge to
        get you the desired results. In addition, personal injury victims who
        are represented by an attorney almost always receive more aid than those
        who are not.
