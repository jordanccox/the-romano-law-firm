        The Romano Law Firm is a full-service personal injury law firm that
        believes in fair compensation for all of our Tulsa clients. If you or
        someone you know has been injured at the fault of another, then you have
        the right to take action. Our experienced attorneys and associated
        handle all types of personal injury cases, and if you have been
        suffering physically, psychologically or financially, then you deserve
        to be heard.

      <p>
        The Romano Law Firm has experience going up against well-armed,
        well-prepared and well-financed insurance companies, and we get our
        clients the desired results. Our greatest strengths lie in our passion
        for helping victims and our persistence in pursuing justice. Insurance
        companies hate when plaintiffs seek a personal injury advisor because
        victims with representation get paid more for injuries.
