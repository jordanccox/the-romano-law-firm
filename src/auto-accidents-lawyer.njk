        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium">CALL US IMMEDIATELY</span> –
        Many people believe that hiring an attorney is the last thing to do.
        However, legal representation early in the process may help you from
        falling into traps and pitfalls, which laypeople may not know about. We
        can make sure that your injury is properly documented (often beginning
        with hospital treatments).
      </p>

        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium"
          >LET US HELP YOU GET THE MEDICAL ATTENTION YOU NEED</span
        >
        – We can make sure that the proper parties are stepping up to the plate
        – and in most cases, we are able to help you avoid a deductible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium"
          >REPORT THE ACCIDENT TO YOUR OWN INSURANCE COMPANY</span
        >
        – In many cases, you have an obligation to report the claim to your own
        insurance company. However, you are cautioned against many pitfalls of
        discussing your injury, or speaking directly with the insurance company
        of the party responsible for the crash. Even during the reporting
        process, it is helpful for legal counsel to be involved with every
        communication with the insurance company so that your interests and
        rights are not violated, and since the Romano Law Firm does not charge
        an hourly rate, there are no legal fees for having us help to handle
        these details.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium">DON’T BE LED BY FEARS</span> –
        After being hit, it can be intimidating to get back on into your life
        and back on the road. Even getting behind the wheel can be a little
        dreadful. Putting you on the path towards wellness and wholeness can be
        reassuring and comforting. The Romano Law Firm can help. We know the
        Way!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium"
          >WE WILL AGGRESSIVELY FIGHT FOR YOU!</span
        >
        – Even the safest drivers can be victims of auto negligence. We know how
        frustrating it can be when you are involved in a car crash. Let us take
        up the fight for you against the insurance companies to defend your
        rights and get you the compensation to which you are entitled.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-center">Filing Claims</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium">YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS</span> –
        Deciding to make a claim may be a difficult decision, but if your
        healing does not come forth speedily, you may have rights and means of
        relief and compensation of which you are unaware. Our job is to make you
        whole again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium"
          >NO FEE OR COST UNTIL WE PREVAIL</span
        >
        – Although most cases are able to be resolved without the need for
        litigation, if a lawsuit does ensue, we gladly front the escalating
        costs of litigation, which are reimbursed only at the conclusion of the
        case, so that you are never “out-of-pocket.” Our fronting of costs is a
        vote of confidence in our own ability to get our clients paid.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium">PROPERTY DAMAGE</span> –
        Additionally, we handle property damage without charging any fee. This
        courtesy is included in our services. Finally, we do not charge any fee
        for medical coverage, which may be available “up front” and payable to
        medical providers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium">BE DILIGENT</span> – Many
        people are apt to take a “wait and see” attitude about their injuries.
        But as weeks or longer go by after an accident, often it becomes to late
        to make a claim.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="text-yellow-600 font-medium">DON’T LET TIME PASS</span> –
        You may at any time change your mind and later decide not to pursue a
        claim, but you will never have another time to set the stage properly or
        document a claim. You will regret not acting now if your injuries turn
        out to be more serious than you initially thought. And by that time, it
        may be too late.
