      <h2 class="text-center">Filing an Auto Accident Claim in Tampa</h2>
      <p>
        Many victims delay to file an auto accident claim because they feel the
        problem can resolve itself, but this is not the case. It’s better to
        file a claim from the start rather than wait. In many cases a minor
        injury can become more serious, but by that time it may be too late to
        file a claim.

        Once you choose to work with the Tampa auto accident lawyers at the

        Most cases are resolved without litigation, but if a lawsuit ensues, we

        Even if you are unsure about filing a claim, it doesn’t hurt to speak to
        an experienced personal injury firm. You can always decide later not to
        pursue a claim, but it pays to at least consider the option. Many
        accident victims realize later on that they would like to file a claim,
        but by that point, it’s too late.
